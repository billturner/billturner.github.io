This is mainly to test how the GitHub pages work, and to get an introductory post up on this weblog.

I've begun to focus on my creative endeavors, like sketching, over on [my other weblog](http://brilliantcorners.org/ "My other weblog"). So, any kind of technical post would now feel out of place over there. Now, I have a place for them.
