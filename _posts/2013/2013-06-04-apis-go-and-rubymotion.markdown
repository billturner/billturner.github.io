First, a few links I've picked up recently on API design and the Go language:

* [Best Practices for Designing a Pragmatic RESTful API](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api)

  > "Now, the internet has no shortage on opinions on API design. But, since there's no one widely adopted standard that works in all cases, you're left with a bunch of choices: What formats should you accept? How should you authenticate? Should your API be versioned?"

* [How to learn Go](http://tumblr.bwong.net/post/52143548323/how-to-learn-go)

  > "Trying to learn a new language is usually kind of confusing because you’re not really sure where to start so here’s my list of resources that helped me learn and deploy a production app in less than a week."

* [Learn Go the hard way](http://learngothehardway.org/)

  > "In this book, I'd like to show you how easy Go is to learn, how well it combines the strengths of both C and Python, and how it makes writing concurrency and parallelism much easier than in most other languages."

And since I've just bought a [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com/) license in order to try and put together some kind of app as a summer project, I've collected quite a few links to catch up on RubyMotion:

* [Official developer docs](http://www.rubymotion.com/developer-center/)
* [Pragmatic Studio free RubyMotion screencast (free)](http://pragmaticstudio.com/screencasts/rubymotion)
* [motioncasts](http://motioncasts.tv/) &mdash; A Railscasts-like subscription screencast service
* [RubyMotion tutorial](http://rubymotion-tutorial.com/)
* [RubyMotion authexample](https://github.com/lucatironi/authexample-ios-rubymotion-tutorial) &mdash; Recent tutorial code up on Github. [Here's the author's weblog](http://lucatironi.github.io/).
