An old post on my other weblog that explains [how to compile Ruby support in Vim](http://brilliantcorners.org/2011/02/building-vim-on-osx-snow-leopard/) continues to get a lot of traffic. Now, compiling Ruby support into Vim in that manner works perfectly fine, but there are _much_ easier ways to accomplish the same thing on a Mac.

I was all set to write out the examples here, but found that [Derek Prior](http://prioritized.net/) did a much better job listing the different ways in his blog post ["Upgrading Vim on OS X"](http://prioritized.net/blog/upgrading-vim-on-os-x/).
