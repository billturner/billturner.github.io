What started to seem like a promising rebirth of [TextDrive](http://textdrive.com/ "The TextDrive home page"), after the [bungled jettison of customers from Joyent](http://gigaom.com/2012/08/30/a-user-revolt-and-the-second-coming-of-textdrive/), has once again turned sour. Really sour. In fact, it appears that no one is minding the store anymore. 

Here's what it looks like now:

  * Dean Allen, who agreed to take over the new incarnation of TextDrive, has more or less gone AWOL where it concerns the current customers of TextDrive.
  * The one employee that was actually doing any work, Jacques, [is no longer being paid](http://discuss.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=888 "Post in Forums on Jacques' situation."). I believe he's since taken a new job, but will occasionally pop in to try and help keep servers online.
  * Dean Allen hasn't posted to the official [TextDrive forum](http://discuss.textdrive.com/ "TextDrive forum home page") since November of 2012.
  * The [@txd](http://twitter.com/txd "TextDrive's official Twitter handle") Twitter handle hasn't been updated since August of last year.
  * The [@TextDriveStatus](http://twitter.com/TextDriveStatus "TextDrive's support Twitter handle") Twitter handle has been a bit more active, but most recently from Jacques' attempts to revive servers. Again, without being paid.
  * At the moment, [Dean Allen's own website](http://textism.com/ "Dean Allen's site") seems to be down. I wonder if it happens to be on one of the TextDrive servers that can't seem to stay online.
  * His own Twitter handle, [@textism](http://twitter.com/textism "Dean Allen's Twitter stream"), hasn't been updated since June of last year.
  * The TextDrive home page hasn't had an update since last August.
  * _Added:_ On Feb. 12th, [Jacques was removed as forum admin](http://discuss.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?pid=8084#p8084).
  * _Added:_ The forum banner text "Hey. Nothing will be deleted or shut down until migration is complete." was [removed sometime around Feb. 17th](http://discuss.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?pid=8146#p8146).
  * At this point, it is safe to assume that no one is handling incoming support issues, and as of yet, there is one one else to take over keeping things running.

So as you can see, TextDrive is just kind of sitting there with seemingly no one in charge.

For some other news on TextDrive, try one of these:

  * The [TextDrive forum](http://discuss.textdrive.com/ "TextDrive's official forum") has a bit of activity, mostly in [the thread discussing alternative hosting options](http://discuss.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=923).
  * The [Twitter search for "textdrive"](https://twitter.com/search?q=textdrive&src=typd&f=realtime) has several variations of "what is going on?" and "where is my site?" in recent tweets.
  * Other [TextDrive-related posts to Hacker News](https://hn.algolia.com/?q=textdrive#!/story/forever/0/textdrive).
  * There's also an ["Ex-Joyeurs" Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ex-joyeurs "Ex-Joyeurs Google Group") that sprung up when we were initially getting the boot from Joyent.

The "Lifetime Hosting" deal I signed up for years ago looks like it is finally going belly up. I've moved anything hosted on TextDrive elsewhere. Right now, I'm more an observer of this mess than anything else.

A recent tweet from the last employee doesn't sound all that hopeful:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidspeed">@davidspeed</a> no clue. Still waiting for an answer on that from Dean.</p>&mdash; Jacques Marneweck (@txdjm) <a href="https://twitter.com/txdjm/statuses/438842219932291072">February 27, 2014</a></blockquote>
